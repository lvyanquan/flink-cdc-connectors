Flink CDC aims to provide users with a more **concise real time and batch data integration**. Users can configure their data synchronization logic using **yaml** api, and submit their jobs to Flink cluster easily. The framework prioritizes efficient end-to-end data integration and offers enhanced functionalities such as full database synchronization, sharding table synchronization, schema evolution and data transformation.    
The following graph shows the architecture layering of Flink CDC:

To learn more about concept of pipeline design, visit our [full documentation](docs/development/concept-pipeline).

### Getting Started

1. Create a Flink cluster [Apache Flink](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/try-flink/local_installation/#starting-and-stopping-a-local-cluster) and set up `FLINK_HOME` environment variable.
2. Download and unzip Flink CDC tar from [release page](https://github.com/apache/flink-cdc/releases), and put jars of pipeline connector to `lib` directory.
3. Create a **yaml** file to describe the expected data source and data sink.    
   The following file named `mysql-to-doris.yaml` provides a concise template:
  ```
      source:
       type: mysql
       name: MySQL Source
       hostname: 127.0.0.1
       port: 3306
       username: admin
       password: pass
       tables: adb.\.*
       server-id: 5401-5404
    
    sink:
      type: doris
      name: Doris Sink
      fenodes: 127.0.0.1:8030
      username: root
      password: pass
    
    pipeline:
       name: MySQL to Doris Pipeline
       parallelism: 4
  ```
4. Submit pipeline job using `flink-cdc.sh` script.
 ```
  bash bin/flink-cdc.sh /path/mysql-to-doris.yaml
 ```
5. View job execution status through Flink WebUI or target database.

Try it out yourself with our more detailed [tutorial](docs/try-flink-cdc/pipeline-connectors/mysql-doris-pipeline-tutorial/). See [connector overall](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-cdc-docs-release-3.0/docs/connectors/pipeline-connectors/overview/) to view a comprehensive catalog of the connectors currently provided and understand more detailed configuration parameters.
